Operating System Benchmarks-
SPEC CPU Benchmark: Paid
This benchmark measures the performance of a CPU by running a variety of compute-intensive tasks. Including this benchmark can help establish a baseline for CPU utilization and performance, as anomalies in CPU usage can indicate issues or intrusions.

Sysbench: Installed on MAC, need linux to download from github and make changes
Command to run benchmark -
Sysbench is a versatile benchmarking tool that can evaluate various system parameters, including CPU, memory, file I/O, and database performance. Including Sysbench can help monitor the overall system health and detect anomalies in different aspects of the OS.

UnixBench: NA
UnixBench is a widely used benchmark suite for Unix-like operating systems. It includes a range of tests that measure system performance and can help identify changes or anomalies in system behavior over time.

Bonnie++: Installed on MAC, need linux to download from github and make changes
This benchmark assesses the I/O performance of a system, including file read/write operations and file creation. Anomalies in I/O behavior can indicate issues such as disk failures or unusual file activity.

netperf/iperf: Installed on MAC, need linux to download from github and make changes
These benchmarks measure network performance and bandwidth. By including them, you can monitor network behavior and detect unusual spikes or drops in network activity, which may indicate network-related anomalies.

Memory Benchmark (e.g., Stream, Linpack): 
Including memory benchmarks can help you monitor memory usage and performance. Anomalies in memory behavior, such as excessive memory leaks or sudden spikes in memory usage, can signal potential issues.

Filesystem Benchmark (e.g., iozone): 
This benchmark evaluates filesystem performance, including file read/write operations and metadata operations. Anomalies in filesystem behavior can indicate issues with storage devices or unusual file access patterns.

Security Benchmarks (e.g., Open Web Application Security Project - OWASP benchmarks): 
Incorporating security benchmarks can help you assess the security posture of the OS. Anomalies in security-related metrics, such as the number of failed login attempts or unauthorized access, can be indicative of security threats.

Power Consumption Benchmark: 
If power consumption is a concern, including a power benchmark can help monitor energy usage and detect anomalies that may suggest hardware issues or inefficient power management.

Application-Specific Benchmarks: 
Depending on your specific use case, consider including benchmarks that are relevant to the applications and services running on your system. For example, if you're running a web server, include benchmarks like ApacheBench or Siege to monitor web server performance.
